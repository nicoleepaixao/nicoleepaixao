<samp>🇧🇷 Nice to meet you, I'm Nicole — a DevOps engineer. Liking tech was never part of the plan — I kind of fell into it by accident, and it turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me. I'm always learning and sharing what I know with those who are still figuring things out.</samp>

<samp>Creator of __Nicloud @nicloudco__ — where I build apps to solve real pain points, whether from people who crossed my path or my own. I really enjoy having this product mindset and exercising my creativity/originality.</samp>
